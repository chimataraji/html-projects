                            But we are charging a premium price for 3 reasons:
                            
                            Unlike other training programs, we simply don’t impart knowledge. We will teach you the EXACT skills that will get a good IT job.

                            All these take humongous effort for our team.
                            
                            We will not leave you like an orphan once the course is over. We’re PROMISING YOU A JOB that pays anywhere between 3.5-6 lakh per annum.
                            
                            No other training program promises you even a JOB. Let alone a well-paying one!

                            No other training program does that in India.
                            
                            We’re investing in your success. Only if you succeed, our efforts will be rewarded. If you don’t get a well-paying IT job as we promised, the financial loss is only for us.
                            
                            So we are demanding the price to ensure you get the best course modules, quality instructors, and results.

                            Consider all these facts, and you will know this would be the best investment for your career
                            
                
                            </p>
                            <p> You probably shouldn’t!

                                But if you are still searching for an IT job with handsome pay and promising career, then you can consider our course.
                                
                                As we said earlier, we will not leave our students like orphans after the course is completed. We are promising you a average 4 Lakhs paying IT job.
                                
                                However, take our program only if you are serious about becoming a well-paid full stack developer in top software companies. Else, be happy with whatever you are doing. God bless!

                                    We are pretty much sure and confident about placement because of the process we follow. If you as candidates are regular to classes, uptodate with assignments and projects, and have cleared mocks (50% clearance) then you will definitely get placed given 1-2 months to placement team after your clearance and only if you are working on the feedback given by us and following our instructions. check out our review videos for further proof.

                                    And we already have a track record of placing more than 350+ students in the last 5 years.

                                    <p> Nope. You cannot.

                                        For a very simple reason.
                                        
                                        We want your 100% dedication and commitment - 8 hours a day, 5 days a week-for 7 months.
                                        
                                        Unless, you pay money from your (or, maybe dad’s or mom’s!) pocket and make a financial commitment, we cannot expect that you will be dedicated to the training.
                                        
                                        You might show up for a few days. Disappear. Come back. Disappear.
                                        
                                        So nope! That’s not going to work for us.
                                        
                                        And we cannot be spending time with non-serious, non-committed students.
