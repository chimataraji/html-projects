            <p> At least three leafy vegetables are combined to prepare this extraordinary dish. It is called Kalagoora Pulusu because of the very fact that many vegetables are brought together to make one dish. ‘Kalagura’ means mixed vegetables. Pulusu refers to the sourness of Tamarind. This dish tastes very nice with hot rice or Chapathi. Traditionally the Telugu people prepare a mixed vegetable dish for Sankranti festival. They use leafy vegetables, Ash Gourd, Drumstick, Sweet Potato, and any other vegetable close at hand to make the mixed sour curry. In this recipe however we are going to use only leafy vegetables.

                        <p> What to cook for breakfast is really a daily puzzle in most homes. The Semiya Uthappam is a wonderful option for such times. It needs just 30 minutes of resting time for the batter. And it is so simple!!! Usually the preparation for Dosa batter starts a day earlier. Instant Dosa is possible but it is not so satisfying as it does not come out as soft as one likes. It becomes harder when it gets cold. The Semiya Uthappam remains soft and tasty even after it gets cold. Just look at the Tips once before you start trying out the recipe.

                        <p> With the passage of time, the Chaddi Annam habit has been replaced by breakfast items like idli, Dosa and Vada. Actually Chaddi Annam has many benefits, especially for people who live in hot regions like the South. Buttermilk is called Challa and Annam is rice boiled to a soft consistency. The name Challa Annam became Chaddannam at some point of time. With some regional variations, mostly everyone in the South eat this Chaddannam for breakfast till the recent past.. The recipe is actually quite simple. There is nothing special that I can add. However, just as the name changed, the method of preparing this dish also underwent many changes. That is why I thought I should introduce the older traditional version to you.

        <p> In southern Indian states, it is mostly Buttermilk Rasam of sorts, seasoned with onions and green chillies. But, why stick to the same old Kadhi recipes? Try this Okra Kadhi and you will fully relish your meal. Many people like Okra/Ladies Fingers but dislike its stickiness.

                <p> But then one day, I tasted this curry in Dhaba near Surat in Gujarat. It was very tasty and I saw that they used Potato in that curry. The taste was fantastic. Moreover, that day, I got a chance to go into their kitchen and interact with them. And I saw firsthand how the curry was made. And I realized the mistakes I made while making Okra with Onions. So this Okra Onion Curry is a combination recipe where I adapted their recipe and added my own experience to it. It goes virtually with anything…Rotis, Puris or Rice.

                <p> I won’t say it is a very special Curry. Usually, for vaangi bath they make the Spice Powder and add it to the Rice. I just added it to the Brinjals, that is all. I am a Telugu and Brinjals, and Gongura (Red Sorrel leaves) are nothing less than a slice of heaven for Telugus. So whenever I come across a new flavor, I start thinking how it goes with Brinjals. That is how I used the Vangi bath Spicy Powder that was left over from making Vaangi Baath Rice to make Vaangi Baath Curry.
